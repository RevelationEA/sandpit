# Digital Learning Domain AI Demo - Model Creation Notes

Date created: 2026-01-23

## Purpose
This model demonstrates how AI can assist in creating an Enterprise Reference Model for the digital learning domain at a UK university. It captures core systems, actors, and data interactions derived from an initial research prompt.

## Process
1. Start with a scoped prompt describing the digital learning domain and asking for core applications, integrations, and roles.
2. Normalize the output into systems, actors, and interactions suitable for a Revelation EA architecture view.
3. Define system properties (name, typical products, and key capabilities) and actor descriptions.
4. Create bidirectional interactions where data flows both ways and describe the entities exchanged.
5. Save the model using the Centered Rectangle layout and add metadata (author, disclaimer, date, and this readme link).

## Source Prompt
"act as an enterprise architect leading the digital learning domain at a UK university. List the core applications that deliver digital learning along with the applications they interact with. In addition list the key roles that interact with these systems."
