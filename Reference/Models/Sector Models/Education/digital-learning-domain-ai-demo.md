<h1>Digital Learning Domain AI Demo - Model Creation Notes</h1>

<p><strong>Date created:</strong> 2026-01-23</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  This model demonstrates how AI can assist in creating an Enterprise Reference Model
  for the digital learning domain at a UK university. It captures core systems, actors,
  and bidirectional data interactions derived from an initial research prompt and then
  structured into a Revelation EA model using a Centered Rectangle layout.
</p>

<h2>Repository and Tooling Context</h2>
<p>
  The model was created directly against the GitHub repository
  <strong>RevelationEA/sandpit</strong> using Codex as a coding agent. Codex was run
  inside the repository working directory so it could add the model JSON, generate this
  README, and update the root model index.
</p>

<h2>Inputs</h2>

<h3>Initial Research Prompt (Claude)</h3>
<pre>
act as an enterprise architect leading the digital learning domain at a UK university. List the core applications that deliver digital learning along with the applications they interact with. In addition list the key roles that interact with these systems.
</pre>

<h3>Codex Prompt Used to Build the Model</h3>
<pre>
Create a Revelation EA for the digital learning domain at UK university. The pupose of the model is to demonstrate the creation of Enterprise Referefence Models using AI. Initial research into the systems, actors and interactions is detail below.

Give the model the TITLE 'Digital Learning Domain AI Demo'. Use Centered Rectangle layout. Add additional model properties such as suthor, disclaimer, date and link to a new readme describing the process for creating the model including this prompt.

Label the system with the name of the application using the TEXT property.Add properties to each system including typical commercial products and the capabilities the system provides.

Label interactions using the TEXT property with a short noun phrase describing the entities Add a description property to the interaction describing the entities in more detail. Add an interaction for each direction entities flow in.

Place the model alongside the Education Sector models and add a revelation EA link to the model to the root level readme. Add another readme alongside the model which describe th process by which the model was create. Provide a link in the model properties to this readme.

<h2>Repeatable Procedure (for third parties)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Clone the repository.</strong>
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/RevelationEA/sandpit.git</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open the repo locally.</strong>
    <pre>cd sandpit</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Launch Codex in the repo root.</strong>
    <p>
      Run Codex in the same directory so it can read and write files. The exact
      command depends on how you run Codex locally. Ensure Codex has permission
      to edit files in the repo.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provide the prompts.</strong>
    <p>
      First gather system/actor/integration research using the Claude prompt in the
      Inputs section. Then provide the Codex prompt (also in the Inputs section) to
      build the Revelation EA model and documentation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Verify the model file paths.</strong>
    <p>
      The model JSON should be saved at:
      <code>Reference/Models/Sector Models/Education/digital-learning-domain-ai-demo.json</code>

      using the same URL pattern as other models.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review in Revelation EA.</strong>
    <p>
      Open the model using the Revelation URL format to confirm layout, labels,
